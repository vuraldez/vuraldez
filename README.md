# Vural Demir

**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Gamer)`**

Hi there, My name is Vural Demir, and I'm a Toronto-based full stack developer. Being occupied by the software sector since I was a young child has made my interest with technology a career passion. Growing with new technologies is something I enjoy doing as a developer in order to create modular, effective, and easy to use solutions. As I work on software development projects and learn about the power of code, I gain new knowledge every day.
